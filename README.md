# ML2020_lectures

This is a repository containing the lectures for the Skoltech's Machine Learning course (MA060018), which is held at Term 3, 2020.

## The list of the current seminars published (will be updated with time):
* LECTURE 1 (04.02) - Course Description and Rules, Overview of Data Analysis, Introduction to ML
* LECTURE 2 (06.02) - Regression
* LECTURE 3 (07.02) - Classification

## Course Description:
The course is a general introduction to machine learning (ML)  is a general introduction to machine learning (ML) and its applications. It covers fundamental modern topics in ML and describes the most important theoretical basis and tools necessary to investigate the properties of algorithms and justify their usage. It also provides important aspects of the algorithmsâ€™ applications, illustrated using real-world problems. The course starts with an overview of canonical ML applications and problems, learning scenarios, etc. and introduction into theoretical foundations of ML. We present the most novel theoretical tools and concepts trying to be as succinct as possible. Then we discuss in-depth fundamental ML algorithms for classification, regression, boosting, etc., their properties as well as their practical applications. The last part of the course is devoted to advanced ML topics such that neural networks, anomaly detection, etc. Within practical sections, we show how to use the methods above to crack various real-world problems. Home assignments include the application of existing algorithms to solve applied industrial problems, the development of modifications of ML algorithms, as well as some theoretical exercises. The students are assumed to be familiar with basic concepts in linear algebra, probability, and real analysis.
